              This is JSON which contains any custom notification settings required for your
              implementation. By default this property is not required if you simply wish to use the
              default style toastrs.<br />
              Manual Notifications: if this is set to true then toastrs are disabled entirely and
              the host will be required to listen to 'certua-ob-notifications' channel on the
              eventbus.
              <br />Use External Toastr Styles: Intended for Internal Certua use, this leaves
              toastrs outside of the shadow dom and the host app has to manage ngx-toastr stylesheet
