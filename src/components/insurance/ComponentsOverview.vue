    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The insurance components are designed to be flexible and easy to use. They are built using
      Angular but exposed as standard web components so can be consumed in any web based language..
    </p>
    <p>
      They take a common set of inputs which might usually only be the
      <code>referrerSiteCode</code> which identifies the insurance product, distributor and the
      theme that is used when rendering the components.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the components also emit certain events and values on the event bus via the standard
      dispatchEvent method, these are made available so that you as the host can further integrate
      the data into your own site. Each component has instructions on how to use it and its
      properties and outputs.
